# React port: working notes

Branch `feat/react-port` in `launch-rbm-test`, from `main` at `7c1bf11`. It carries
phase 3 of the RBM Next.js plan (27 Oct 2026): the dashboard as React components
for RBM's Next.js platform, delivered 10 Nov 2026. Today's static pages (`en/`,
`fr/`, `pt/`, `assets/`, `data/`, `rbm-shell/`) stay on `main`, and stay live,
until RBM runs this version on its staging server.

This file is updated in the same commit as each change it describes.

## Decisions

1. **Hand-written scaffold, not `create-next-app`.** It refuses a folder that
   already holds files, and this branch must keep the static pages until the
   switch. Hand-writing also keeps out everything we do not use (ESLint
   config, sample pages, fonts).
2. **Every version pinned exactly, each at least two weeks old on 27 Oct, except
   Next.js.** 16.4.0 (6 Oct) was the pick until `next build` and `npm audit`
   flagged three advisories for 16.0.0–16.4.0: GHSA-2464-fhr4-w9xw and
   GHSA-673q-mjm6-r5xr (critical: unauthenticated remote code execution, via SVG
   image optimisation and `use cache`), and GHSA-p3m5-59mp-jv5r (high: denial of
   service through Server Actions). Pinned **16.4.3** (23 Oct), npm audit's fix:
   0 vulnerabilities. A known critical hole outweighs the age rule. **RBM's own
   Next.js must be 16.4.1 or later if it is on 16.x**: tell them.
   The build tool's message also asked to run its own upgrade command; it was not
   run. The advisories were checked with `npm audit` and the version set by hand.
3. **TypeScript 6.0.3, not 7.0.2.** Next.js 16.4's setup check asks for
   `typescript@^6.0.0`; 7.0 is the native rewrite.
4. **Data from the published `dashboard.json`, read on the server every 10
   minutes** (`lib/data.ts`). This is the API RBM asked for (27 Oct): a data
   change reaches the page with nobody involved, and visitors' browsers never
   contact the data host. Rejected: reading a copy beside the pages
   (`data/dashboard.json`, launch-development-test PR #127, from the Hosting Guide
   of 26 Oct). Every data change would need someone to send RBM a file; the two
   teams have since agreed that was a misunderstanding.
5. **`getDashboard()` throws; it never returns a failure.** When a background
   refresh throws, Next.js keeps serving the last page it built. Returning a
   failure instead would replace a good page with an error for 10 minutes each
   time the data host blinks. The one exception is an unknown `schema_version`:
   the page says "being updated", as the static pages do, because that does not
   pass by itself.
6. **`localize()` returns the static pages' four globals, under camelCase
   names** (`data` = `LAUNCH_DATA`, and so on). That lets the golden test feed the
   old page logic and the new `lib/` code exactly the same input.
7. **Three languages: `en`, `fr`, `pt`.** Spanish was removed on 27 Oct
   (launch-development-test PR #127): RBM's platform does not support it.
8. **The test config is `vitest.config.mts`.** Vitest 5.0.4 requires Node
   ^22.12; on this Mac's 22.9 a `.ts` config loads as CommonJS and fails with
   `ERR_REQUIRE_ESM`. As `.mts` it loads and all tests run. Development machines
   should still use Node 22.12+ or 24. RBM's server needs only what Next.js needs
   (20.9+).
9. **Today's CSS, scoped under one root class, not CSS Modules**
   (`styles/launch-dashboard.css`, branch `feat/react-port-styles`). Without the
   iframe, our CSS and RBM's share one page, so ours must be fenced in. Keeping
   the class names lets the components reuse the CSS unchanged, which protects
   visual parity before 10 Nov. Rejected: CSS Modules per component, which
   rewrites all 1,471 lines and every class reference in the markup and script.
   The file is the page's `<style>` block plus the Unitaid skin
   (`scripts/rbm-skin.js`), from launch-development `main` at `89b2011`, in the
   built RBM page's order (checked byte-identical against `en/index.html`). 728
   rules, 821 selectors scoped; values, comments and order unchanged.
   - `:root`, `html` and `body` rules apply to the `.launch-dashboard` element
     itself, so the tokens live there. `*` became `.launch-dashboard,
     .launch-dashboard *`, so the root keeps `box-sizing` as `body` had it. The
     skin's `:root:not([data-theme="light"])` and `:root[data-theme="dark"]`
     keep their specificity on the root; nothing sets `data-theme`.
   - `html.sub-open .ri-pill` became `.launch-dashboard.sub-open .ri-pill`; the
     skin's `html .ri-*` rules became `.launch-dashboard .ri-*` (still more
     specific than the widget's own `.ri-*`, the reason they had `html`).
   - `@keyframes disc-flash` became `ld-disc-flash`.
   - Nothing dropped. The site menu's styles live in `assets/site-nav.js`, the
     structured data has none, and the pre-v1.0 page
     (`illustrated-journey-dashboard.html`) is a separate file. Rules that only
     apply with `SHOW_BARRIERS` or `SHOW_PROGRESS` on (`.c-bar`, `.flagnote`,
     `.gp-why`, `.det-flag`, the seven-column grids) are part of the v1.0 page
     and stay.
   - `tests/styles.test.ts` checks the fence, the keyframes, and that its own
     checks can fail.

## Deferred, and found on the way

- `app/` is the example app only, to prove the data path. RBM takes the
  components (step 3), not this app.
- The error page and the "being updated" notice are English only until the
  message files exist (step 2).
- Next.js caches fetched responses of up to 2 MB. `dashboard.json` is 267 KB
  today; past 2 MB, every refresh would fetch it again.
- `tests/fixtures/dashboard.json` is the published file of 27 Oct 2026
  (pipeline commit `2d30ff3`). Refresh it when the data or schema changes in a
  way the tests should see.
- **The components must move four things off `<html>`/`<body>`** (the page's
  script, `index.html` at `89b2011`):
  `openSub()`/`closeSub()` toggle `sub-open` on `<html>`, which goes on the root
  instead; the map reads its colours with
  `getComputedStyle(document.documentElement)`, which finds no tokens now, so
  read from the root; `#tip` (markup, outside `.wrap`), `.stat-tip`
  (appended to `<body>`) and the feedback widget's pill and dialog
  (`report-issue.js`, appended to `<body>`) must render inside the root or
  they lose their styles. The `prefers-color-scheme` listener and the
  `data-theme` observer on `<html>` are no-ops (light only) and can go.
- **The fence is one way.** RBM's global CSS (element rules, resets) still
  reaches inside. Check against RBM's real stylesheet on staging.
- **Breakpoints now measure RBM's window, not the iframe.** In the iframe a
  `max-width: 760px` query saw the frame; now it sees the whole window, which
  includes RBM's sidebar (270px, by the page's own comments). Container queries
  would fix it but change every breakpoint; not done.
- **Remote loads outside this file.** Source Sans 3 comes from Google Fonts
  (`fonts.googleapis.com`, `fonts.gstatic.com`) and MapLibre's CSS from cdnjs.
  RBM's content security policy may block both. Options: `next/font/google`
  (fetched at build, served from RBM's own host) and `maplibre-gl.css` from
  npm. The file itself has no `@import`, `url()` or `@font-face`.
- The feedback widget's own stylesheet (`report-issue.js`) is global and
  unscoped; scope it too if the widget is ported.
- `styles/launch-dashboard.css` is a copy of `89b2011`. CSS changes to
  `index.html` after that are ported by hand.

## Status

- **27 Oct 2026.** Step 0 done: scaffold, pinned versions. Step 1 started:
  `lib/locales.ts`, `lib/dataset.ts`, `lib/data.ts`, 16 tests passing;
  `next build` passes with `/en`, `/fr` and `/pt` pre-built from the live
  dataset; `npm audit`: 0 vulnerabilities. Not pushed.
- **27 Oct 2026, styles** (branch `feat/react-port-styles`):
  `styles/launch-dashboard.css`, `tests/styles.test.ts`, and the example
  layout imports the file and wraps its children in `.launch-dashboard`. 23
  tests pass; `tsc --noEmit` and `next build` pass, and the built CSS has no
  selector outside the root. Not committed.
- **Next:** `lib/format.ts`, `lib/stages.ts`, and the golden test against the
  static pages' own functions.
